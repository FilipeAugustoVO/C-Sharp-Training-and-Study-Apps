Cornucópia is the fourth planet of a star system of ten. Owned by a group of Olisbonian Arcadian pastorialists and farmers, its inhabitants believed that communion with nature was the key to a fulfilling life. The Arcadians believed that man's enviroment was nature, and that man should keep as close to nature as possible. They were painted as luddites and regressives, but that would be a lie.

I remember when it started. I always loved astronomy, and the stars. I lived a simple life, as most people in our planet did. I lived in my family's fields, where we got by through the raising of quality "natural" sheep, whose products we often traded with interplanetary trade, for genuine sheep milk and fleece were much in demand among the elite classes of humans in this galaxy. Good, honest money.

For the people of Cornucópia believed that technology was useful and should be used when needed, but not obsessed about. They preferred to limit their technology, keeping their factories and industries bellow the ground, or in places whose pollution would't matter, like their two moons. They kept their cities small, vertical and green.

The first sign of something wrong was detected by automated astronomical sensors. Signs of pertubed orbits in the outer parts of its star system. 

----------

I remember the first signs, and to this day, I wonder if I could have done anything to prevent it, to change our fate. Yet, now as then, I perceive that there was no way I, a lone amateur astronomer and shepherd, could have realized what was truly happening.

For what was happening, at first, looked natural. 

----------

At first, none gave it much thought - those pertubed orbits were normal, as the system was not a solitary star, but a double system, orbited by a very fast-orbiting star, one which returned every generation to a closer orbit. The "Pass of the Second Sun" was not only normal, but a cause for a great planet-wide festival that marks the start of a new generation.

----------

It was normal, to us, for the outer orbits to change. The Second Sun was returning, and with it, great cheer would come. I started to think about the coming festival. My worries, then, were about inviting the neighbooring girl to go with me to the great festival. She was nice, demure and fun, her dark chocolate skin and beautiful curls much attractive to me, and we always had a good... connection. Perhaps it was time for it to become something more.

Amateur astronomers

----------

For a few days, things continued as normal, amateur and professional astronomers telling the youth about the wonder of the Second Sun's passing.
But, things changed. The orbits started changing in strange ways. I heard this from a friend, a bit of a crank, said he gazed at his family telescope, and found the outer planet orbits a bit strange. I decided to look into it myself, maybe I would be the first witness to a new astronomical discovery.
